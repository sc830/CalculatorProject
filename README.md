### Project Overview ###
In this project, a basic calculator application was provided, and I was tasked with adding trigonometric functions to the calculator, implementing unit testing to prevent errors, and improving its GUI to make the calculator more visually appealing. This project provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of utilizing Java Swing, JUnit, code refactoring, and modular design.

### Features ###
Updated GUI: A redesigned and improved user interface using Java Swing components.
New Functionality: Added advanced mathematical operations.
Enhanced User Experience: Improved user interaction with a cleaner and more visually appealing design.
Error Prevention: Prevented user errors by adjusting existing components' input handling and implementing unit testing.

### Getting Started ###
Clone this repository to your device, then compile and run the Calculator.java file.

### Skill Development ###
While working on this project, I expanded upon several key skills:

Java Swing: Deepened understanding of Java Swing for building desktop GUI applications.
Event Handling: Learned effective event handling for user interactions in a GUI environment.
Java Design Patterns: Applied design patterns to enhance code modularity and maintainability.
GUI Design: Gained insights into designing user-friendly interfaces for better user experience.
Code Revision and Restructuring: Gained experience in modifying existing code to suit new purposes.
SOLID Refactoring: Worked through project redesign to better reflect SOLID principles.
Unit Testing: Gained an understanding of the importance of unit testing and how it is implemented.
